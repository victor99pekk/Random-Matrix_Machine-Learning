# Maximum cut: `Heuristic algorithm` vs `Deep Learning`
We generate graphs with nodes containing either group A or B. Nodes in A are connected to nodes in group
A with a probability of x_a and to nodes in group B with probability x_b.

In this experiment we compare the performance of a `heuristic maximum cut` algorithm, with `deep learning`.


## what we need:
1. function to create an adjacency graph between n number of nodes in a graph. connecting the nodes from the different groups with the correct probability
2. heuristic maximum cut algrithm
3. deep learning algorithm, several graphs for training
