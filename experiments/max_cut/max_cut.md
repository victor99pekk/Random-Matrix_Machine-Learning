# Maximum cut: `Heuristic algorithm` vs `Deep Learning`
In this experiment we compare the performance of a `heuristic maximum cut` algorithm, with `deep learning` to solve the maxmimum cut problem the best we can.


## what we need:
1. function to create an adjacency graph between n number of nodes in a graph. connecting the nodes from the different groups with the correct probability
2. heuristic maximum cut algrithm
3. deep learning algorithm, several graphs for training


__`Graph spec:`__ the graphs we use in this experiments contain nodes, where every node contain one of
