# Possible Applications in ML  
I have found some applications, and an LLM has found some. All "sources"/"places to find out more" were found by the search function in chatgpt though, so take them with a grain of salt, as a possible place to find out more. 


`It is possible to read about most of the applications listed below in either RMT4ML.pdf or HDP.pdf`

### 1. Understanding the Neural Network Training and Generalization  
- The Hessian (second derivative of the loss function) captures the curvature of the loss landscape, and its eigenvalues provide insights into optimization and generalization.  
- RMT helps analyze the spectral density of Hessians, showing that neural network loss landscapes often have a bulk of near‐zero eigenvalues with some outliers, which affects convergence behavior.  
- Fisher information matrices (which quantify the sensitivity of predictions to weight changes) also follow RMT distributions and can be used to study generalization capacity.  

**Applications:**  
✔ Diagnosing sharp vs. flat minima in loss landscapes (flat minima generalize better).  
✔ Understanding why neural networks avoid poor local minima despite non-convexity.  
✔ Designing better optimization algorithms (e.g., adapting learning rates based on spectral properties).

### 2. Spectral Pruning & Model Compression  
- Eigenvalue analysis of weight matrices identifies directions in the data space that contribute least to variance (small eigenvalues).  
- Spectral pruning removes these insignificant directions, leading to a smaller, more efficient network with minimal loss in performance.  

**Applications:**  
✔ Reducing model size while maintaining accuracy (important for deploying ML models on edge devices).  
✔ Improving efficiency in training and inference.

### 3. Double Descent & Generalization in Overparameterized Models  
- The **double descent phenomenon** refers to how test error initially decreases with more model parameters, then increases, and then decreases again in overparameterized models.  
- RMT provides a theoretical framework to explain this behavior by analyzing covariance matrices of random feature models.

**Applications:**  
✔ Helps justify why modern deep learning models can generalize well despite being heavily overparameterized.  
✔ Guides optimal model selection to avoid overfitting or underfitting.

✔ Selecting better kernel functions in high-dimensional learning tasks.  
✔ Improving the efficiency of kernel-based models by approximating kernel matrices with low-rank approximations.

### 6. Stability & Robustness in Machine Learning Models  
- RMT can be used to study the stability of gradient-based optimization methods by analyzing the spectral properties of weight updates.
