link: https://ucsd.zoom.us/my/rayansaab 


MEETING 1:

Chapter 1,2, 3, 4 extra important!, (kinchine not improtnat)

then cool stuff happens at chapter 5... and forward. but the initial chapters are very important to understand the rest.

how far can we get into chapter 2 for next week?

-------------------------------------------------------

MEETING 2:

notes: 
markovs inequality; if we have expectwed value for X withy t, we hae the same for X^2 with t^2. we get function s with the  

TODO:
-go through all proofs chapter 2, understand all

-------------------------------------------------------


MEETING 3:

QUESTIONS:
hoeffdings:
1. assumption of the 2-norm of a in hoeffding proof being 1? is it since we can multiply the LHS & RHS
with a scalar?
2. assume bound is {-1, 1} for the bernoulli random variable? 
do we loose any generality when we assume the bounds like this?
3. are the a:s in the hoeffdings inequality a problem?

chernoffs:
3. how did we loose the a:s that we had in the corresponding function
in hoeffdings. equation (2.7)
4. why would you want to use hoeffdings instead of chernoff
5. is chernoff better because of the factor (1/t) in the denominator?
6. what does it mean to assume a MGF?

graph application:
d â‰¥ C * log(n) ?

-------------------------------------------------------



MEETING 4:

QUESTIONS:
1. when are the coordinates in a random isotropic vector independent? is it when the length of
the vector i random?
2. why does he show 2 proofs of grothendieck? especially when one is considerably worse?

PLAN NEXT WEEK:
- look at maximum cut; use cases, complexity...
- start next chapter
