then cool stuff happens at chapter 5... and forward. but the initial chapters are very important to understand the rest.

how far can we get into chapter 2 for next week?

-------------------------------------------------------

MEETING 2:

notes: 
markovs inequality; if we have expectwed value for X withy t, we hae the same for X^2 with t^2. we get function s with the  

TODO:
-go through all proofs chapter 2, understand all

-------------------------------------------------------


MEETING 3:

QUESTIONS:
hoeffdings:
1. assumption of the 2-norm of a in hoeffding proof being 1?
2. assume bound is {-1, 1} for the bernoulli random variable? 
do we loose any generality when we assume the bounds like this?
3. are the a:s in the hoeffdings inequality a problem?

chernoffs:
3. how did we loose the a:s that we had in the corresponding function
in hoeffdings. equation (2.7)
4. why would you want to use hoeffdings instead of chernoff
5. is chernoff better because of the factor (1/t) in the denominator?
6. what does it mean to assume a MGF?
