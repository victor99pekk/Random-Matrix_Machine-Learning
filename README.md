# Random Matrix Theory applied in Machine Learning
This is the repository for an ongoing reserach study in the application of random matrix theory in machine learning conducted by `Victor Pekkari` and `Armon Haghighi` at University of California, San Diego.


## Current stage:
- Reading chapter 4 of High dimensional probability (in papers-folder)
- Experimenting / programming with the max cut problem


## Contents:
__`papers`-folder:__ contains all the literature that we have studied in this project

__`project_proposal`-folder:__ has the inital proposal on what applications of random matrix theory in machine learning to research, and also a outline for a schedule

__`experiments`-folder:__ contains all experiments we have coded including folders for each experiment, there is for example one folder belonging to the max_cut experiments we have done
