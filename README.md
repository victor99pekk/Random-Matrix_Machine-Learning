# Random Matrix Theory applied in Machine Learning
This is the repository for an ongoing reserach study in the application of random matrix theory in machine learning conducted by `Victor Pekkari` and `Armon Haghighi` at University of California, San Diego.


## Contents:
__`papers`-folder:__ contains all the literature that we have studied in this project

__`max_cut`-folder:__ This folder contains the initial experiment work for our independent study, focusing on the Max-Cut problem using neural networks and heurisitc methods like Semidefinite Programming. The project was later continued and expanded in this repo: [Max Cut](https://github.com/victor99pekk/Max_Cut)

__`project_proposal`-folder:__ has the inital proposal on what applications of random matrix theory in machine learning to research, and also a outline for a schedule.
