For a solid grounding and practical perspective, consider these chapters from RMT4ML.pdf:

• Chapter 1 – Introduction: This chapter sets the stage by discussing the pitfalls of high-dimensional 
statistics and motivating why random matrix theory (RMT) is useful for modern machine learning.

• Chapter 2 – Random Matrix Theory: It covers the fundamental objects and key results of RMT, including 
spiked models and concentration phenomena, which will give you the theoretical background needed.

• Chapter 4 – Kernel Methods: If you're interested in how RMT applies to kernel-based methods in ML, 
this chapter dives into the behavior of random kernel matrices and their implications.

• Chapter 5 – Large Neural Networks: This chapter explores RMT in the context of neural networks, 
including analysis of gradient descent dynamics and recurrent networks, which is valuable if you plan to work with deep learning.

Additionally, Chapter 8 on Universality and Real Data offers insights on how these theories apply to 
practical datasets. These chapters together provide both the foundational theory and its applications to machine learning.
