## 🧠 Things You Should Understand Deeply

1. **Concentration**: How tightly a random variable clusters around its mean.
2. **Tail behavior**:
   - Sub-Gaussian = light tails = strong concentration.
   - Sub-Exponential = heavier tails = weaker concentration.
3. **When to use which inequality**:
   - **Chebyshev**: Any variable with variance (weak).
   - **Hoeffding**: Bounded variables.
   - **Chernoff**: Bernoulli (binary).
   - **Bernstein**: Sub-exponential variables.
4. **Sub-Gaussian & Sub-Exponential classes**: Fundamental for high-dimensional probability.
5. **Application of concentration inequalities**:
   - Bounding probabilities of deviations.
   - Using **union bounds** for high-probability guarantees.
