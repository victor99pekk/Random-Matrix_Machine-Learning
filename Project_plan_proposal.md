# Proposal plan for project (first draft)
__`Terms:`__ we have total of `9 weeks` for this project. During these 9 weeks we have to `learn` about RMT, some application/applications to ML, `program` something related and then `present` everything we have done in a final report.

We should just keep going if we feel like we are done with a phase before the set deadline. There is no need to wait for the next phase to begin.

## Phase 0: Come up with plan
- week 1

__`Goal:`__ Draft the initial project proposal and outline to share with our supervisor

Come up with what is important to learn in `random matrix theory` and what applications in `machine learning` we should study. here we should come up with several applications for the professor to choose which ones he thinks is the best one for us to pursue.

## Phase 1: Background and Theoretical Review
- week 2-5

__`Goal:`__ Build a solid foundation in `random matrix theory` and the chosen applications in `ML`.

We can do this by reading papers on current reserach as well as reading informations we find online about the field


## Phase 2: Programming...
- week 6-7

__`Goal:`__ Program experiments or a project that centers around `RMT` in `ML`.

This part can either be a project where we try to build something, where we try to apply RMT to some machine learning concept. It can also be a set of experiments where we test our own hypothesis or theory that we have studied. The programming language should probably be `python` since it has a lot of helpful libraries

## Phase 3: Reporting
- week 7-8

__`Goal:`__ Get a written overleaf report, and a nice GitHub repo to present what we have done/learnt during this project

The report shuold be in the style of a scientific paper, reporting what we e.g have `learnt, programmed, concluded, experiments, done for project`. `Phase 3` is what we will ultimately be "graded" on.

## Phase 4
- week 9

__`Goal:`__ Correct report after review from the professor

This is the `final` phase
